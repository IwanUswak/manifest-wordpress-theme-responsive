Manifest wordpress theme responsive
===================================

This repository holds the CSS file that tries (yep, this is work in progress
yet) to make the [Manifest wordpress theme](http://themes.jimbarraud.com/manifest/) to act responsively.

I'm using this on [my blog](http://pothix.com/blog).

Feel free to fork it and contribute back.
